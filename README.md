# Wicca
This is a repo for my potential Minecraft mod about Wicca and other forms on magick. If you have any ideas on what to add to my mod, please add them under the "List of things to add" section below!!

## List of things to add (WIP)
1. Salt (act as redstone so you can make a circle)
2. Blessed Water
3. Spells (possibly as potions)
4. Spellbook (possible in-game manual)
5. Athame
6. Rituals for sacred holidays (8 in total)
7. Altar (possible crafting mechanism)
8. Pentagrams (possible spell activator/distributor)
